Combined Districts Concert Band presents: Carols N’ More - An End of Year Concert

This concert not only looks back on the year we’ve had, but also forward to Nationals next year. For those young at heart there’ll also be some Christmas carols to sing along to! We’ll be presenting our 2019 awards; The Eric Cooper Award, Encouragement Award and Musical Director's Award.

Doors open at 1:30PM for a 2:00PM start. Tea, coffee and cake available for a donation. BYO food and drink is welcome. Please note the venue is strictly alcohol free.
