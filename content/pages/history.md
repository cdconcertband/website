Combined Districts Concert Band was formed on 30th March 1987. Originally known as Northern Districts Band, the name was changed in 1989 to more accurately reflect the metropolitan regions from which members are drawn. It was incorporated under this name in September 1989.

 

Predominantly a youth band, the current membership is approximately thirty-five players ranging in age from fourteen years old. New members are always welcome with younger players given every encouragement and opportunity to develop their musical skills. The Band is a self funding body, charging a membership fee, but has enjoyed some sponsorship and support from various companies from time to time.

 

The Band has an extensive repertoire ranging from old standards and light popular to the latest original compositions. The Band has three main performance styles: a concert performance, for indoor or outdoor venues; a standing static performance, suitable for appearances at sporting events, shows or festivals; and a marching band which performs in street parades and public events such as ANZAC Day parades and the Perth Christmas Pageant. Public engagements over the years have included appearances at the Perth Royal Show, Royal Freshwater Bay Yacht Club, Dancesport WA Championships and many concert performances at various venues throughout Perth.

 

The Western Australian Band Association State Championships are normally held in May each year. The Combined Districts Concert Band has held the title of Western Australian ‘A’ Grade Concert Band Champions from 1995 to 2004. In recent years the band has not participated in the state championships.

 

The Band endeavours to undertake a tour every few years and in January 1996, completed a tour to Devonport, Tasmania and the Gold Coast, Queensland. January 1999 saw the Band complete a very successful tour of New Zealand, presenting concert performances on both islands in places such as Christchurch, Auckland and Rotorua. A successful tour was also held in January 2005, in which the band members visited various parts of Queensland; the Sunshine Coast, Brisbane and the Gold Coast, and Sydney. In 2008 the band toured Singapore and Malaysia, performing at such places as the KL Twin Towers.
