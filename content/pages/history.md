Combined Districts Concert Band was formed on 30th March 1987. Originally known as Northern Districts Band, the name was changed in 1989 to more accurately reflect the metropolitan regions from which members are drawn. It was incorporated under this name in September 1989.

 

A band of all ages, the current membership is approximately thirty-five players ranging in age from seventeen years old. New members are always welcome with younger players given every encouragement and opportunity to develop their musical skills. The Band is a self funding body, charging a membership fee, but has enjoyed some sponsorship and support from various companies from time to time.

 

The Band has an extensive repertoire ranging from old standards and light popular to the latest original compositions. The Band has three main performance styles: a concert performance, for indoor or outdoor venues; a standing static performance, suitable for appearances at sporting events, shows or festivals; and a marching band which performs in street parades and public events such as ANZAC Day parades and the Perth Christmas Pageant. Public engagements over the years have included appearances at the Alinta Energy Christmas Pageant, Raine Square, Craigie Leisure Centre and many concert performances at various venues throughout Perth.

 

The Western Australian Band Association State Championships are normally held in May each year. The Combined Districts Concert Band held the title of Western Australian ‘A’ Grade Concert Band Champions from 1995 to 2004. In recent years the band has participated in 'B' Grade, working on the development of musicianship of the band and it's players.

 

The Band has travelled on many tours, visiting Devonport, Tasmania, Queensland and Sydney. Internationally, Combined Districts Concert Band has travelled to New Zealand, Singapore and Malaysia.
